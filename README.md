🎨 Color Detection Project

This is a simple Color Detection app built using Python and OpenCV. It allows users to detect the name and RGB values of any color in an image by clicking on it.

⚙️ How It Works

The program loads an image using OpenCV.

On mouse click, it detects the color at that point.

It compares the RGB value with a CSV file (colors.csv) containing color names and codes.

Displays the closest matching color name on the image window.
